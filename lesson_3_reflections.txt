When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to work with a wider team, or have backups for my repository
available other than my local machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might have changes in my branch that I want to work on or keep before I pull
the latest changes that were committed to the remote repository. Also, doing
a pull will overwrite the changes in my branch.
