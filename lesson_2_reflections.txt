What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When initializing a repository, git creates the .git directory which contains
the metadata related to each file in the containing directory that might get
tracked for versioning. It is required for git to have the metadata it needs to
start versioning your files, and performing all other git operations on them
and the newly created repository.
